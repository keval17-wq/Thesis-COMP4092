# Week 7 Logbook Entry

## Discussion Points

1. **Multi-Document Summarization:**
   - Explored the use of multi-document summarization techniques for summarizing user feedback. Emphasized the importance of reviewing how similar methods have been applied in previous research.

2. **Presentation Preparation:**
   - Discussed the need for practicing presentation skills, including clearly articulating research objectives, methodology, and findings.

3. **Reference Collection and Classification:**
   - Focused on finding and identifying 15-20 relevant references. The goal is to classify these references based on their use of machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), or older technologies for user feedback analysis.

4. **Evidence-Based Research:**
   - Emphasized the importance of evidence-based research. All claims must be supported by proper citations and references. Avoid making unproven claims and ensure that every point is backed by evidence from credible sources.

5. **Literature Review Process:**
   - Continued work on the literature review, which will involve extensive citation and referencing of key sources. This will help in building a solid foundation for the research.

6. **Document Review:**
   - Plan to review Sahithiâ€™s top-tier document and another relevant document. Focus on any summaries of data, annotated samples, and evaluation methods provided.

7. **Feedback Summarization Techniques:**
   - Discussed techniques for summarizing user feedback, including clustering and topic modeling. Noted that modern approaches, such as those used by ChatGPT, involve grouping themes and summarizing common topics from text.

8. **Pre-LLM Techniques:**
   - Reviewed older techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and their relevance compared to newer methods. Considered how prompt engineering and combining techniques can enhance summarization efforts.

9. **Chain of Thought:**
   - Explored the concept of Chain of Thought (CoT) or Channel of Thought, which provides a structured approach to thinking through problems and summarizing information.

## Work Completed

1. **Excel Sheet for Extensive Evaluation Criteria:**
   - The Excel sheet outlining extensive evaluation criteria was reviewed and confirmed to align with the assessment rubric.

2. **Google Drive Updates:**
   - Updated Google Drive with the template file, project proposal abstract, and a comprehensive list of resources relevant to the thesis topic.

3. **Finalize Research Questions:**
   - Research questions have been refined and finalized based on the discussions and literature review.

4. **Literature Review:**
   - Continued the literature review process, summarizing key works and aligning findings with the research questions.

5. **Resource Verification:**
   - Verified resources using Scopus, SciVal, and ACL Anthology, focusing on user feedback summarization and linguistic aspects.

6. **Summarizing User Feedback:**
   - Explored methods for summarizing user feedback and documented these methods for integration into the final thesis.

## Work Being Completed

1. **Resource Collection and Initial Review:**
   - Collecting and reviewing papers from Scopus and SciVal, focusing on research relevant to the thesis topic.
   - Identified a preliminary list of research questions based on literature trends.

## Plan for Week 8

1. **Complete Literature Review:**
   - Finalize the literature review section, integrating findings from recent paper reviews and aligning with research questions.

2. **Draft Full Proposal:**
   - Begin drafting the complete project proposal, incorporating the finalized research questions, literature review, and methodology.

3. **Finalize Resource List:**
   - Ensure the final list of resources is comprehensive and up-to-date. Continue verifying the quality and relevance of sources.

4. **Refine Feedback Methods:**
   - Refine and document methods for summarizing user feedback, ensuring practical application for the thesis.

5. **Practice Presentation:**
   - Practice presentation skills and prepare for upcoming presentations, focusing on effectively communicating research objectives and findings.

6. **Explore Multi-Document Summarization Techniques:**
   - Continue exploring multi-document summarization techniques for summarizing user feedback and how they can be integrated into the thesis.
