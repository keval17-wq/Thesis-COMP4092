# Week 9 Logbook Entry

### Discussion Points
1. **Clustering and Embeddings**: Define clustering within the context of summarizing user feedback and explain how embeddings support this process.
2. **Automatic Evaluation Tools**: Explore additional metrics to complement ROUGE in evaluating summarization quality.
3. **Dataset Finalization**: Select the most suitable dataset for preliminary summarization and evaluation.

### Work Completed
1. Completed literature review and submitted it for preliminary feedback.
2. Defined the methodology for clustering using embeddings.

### Work Being Completed
1. Ongoing revisions on the literature review based on received feedback.
2. Structuring project proposal with finalized methodology.

### Plan for Week 10
1. Continue drafting and refining the project proposal.
2. Develop a pipeline to implement clustering and summarization for selected dataset.

### Queries for Clarification
1. Additional datasets recommended for user feedback analysis?
2. Suggestions on combining metrics for a comprehensive evaluation approach?
