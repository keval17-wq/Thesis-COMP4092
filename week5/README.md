# Week 5 Logbook Entry

## Discussion Points

1. **Clarification on Assessment Rubric:**
   - Discussed the importance of understanding the assessment rubric, shared via email during Week 4. This will guide the structure of my work and ensure that I meet all required criteria.

2. **Current Trends in the Field:**
   - Need to examine what professionals and researchers are currently doing in the relevant field. This will help identify gaps, opportunities, and ensure that my research is aligned with contemporary practices.

3. **Strategy for Moving Forward:**
   - Outlined a rough plan for proceeding with the research, including gathering more information on summarizing user feedback effectively and verifying the quality of resources using tools like Scopus, SciVal, and the ACL Anthology for linguistics.

4. **Report Writing and Resource Verification:**
   - Emphasized the importance of selecting high-quality sources, such as those from the Science Citation Index, Scopus, and others. The goal is to thoroughly review relevant literature and identify key research and ongoing work in the same area.
   - Key sections of the report include listing relevant papers, defining research questions, reviewing relevant work, and referencing researchers working in the same area.

## Work Completed

1. **Excel Sheet for Extensive Evaluation Criteria:**
   - Created an Excel sheet outlining extensive evaluation criteria in response to the assessment rubric shared in Week 4. This document reflects a thorough understanding of the assessment requirements and will be attached for review during the Week 5 meeting.

2. **Reflection Document:**
   - Compiled a document summarizing the project understanding so far. This reflection has been attached and included in the resources to be reviewed before the Week 6 meeting.

## Work Being Completed

1. **Resource Collection and Initial Review:**
   - Collecting and reviewing key papers using Google Scholar, Scopus, and SciVal, focusing on research relevant to my thesis topic.
   - Identified a preliminary list of research questions based on trends observed in the literature.

## Plan for Week 6

1. **Finalize Research Questions:**
   - Refine and finalize the research questions that my thesis will address based on discussions in Week 5.

2. **Literature Review:**
   - Continue identifying and reviewing relevant papers, focusing on both the quality of sources and relevance to the research questions.
   - Continue drafting the literature review section by summarizing key works and identifying where my research fits within the current landscape.

3. **Resource Verification:**
   - Ensure all resources are verified for quality using indices such as Scopus, SciVal, and the ACL Anthology, focusing on user feedback summarization, linguistic aspects of the thesis, and other available resources.

4. **Summarizing User Feedback:**
   - Continue exploring methods and tools for effectively summarizing user feedback, ensuring that this process is well-documented and can be integrated into the final thesis.

## Queries for Clarification

1. **Research Scope:**
   - Should I narrow down the research questions to focus on a specific sub-area within the field, or should the scope remain broad?

2. **Resource Quality:**
   - Are there any specific criteria or additional resources beyond Scopus, SciVal, and the ACL Anthology that I should consider for ensuring the quality of my sources if I run dry?

3. **User Feedback Summarization:**
   - Do you have any recommendations for tools or methods that would best suit the summarization of user feedback in the context of my research?
