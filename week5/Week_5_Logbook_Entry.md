# Week 5 Logbook Entry

## Discussion Points

1. **Clarification on Assessment Rubric:**
   - I discussed the importance of understanding the assessment rubric, which was shared via email during Week 4. This will guide the structure of my work and ensure that I meet all the required criteria.

2. **Current Trends in the Field:**
   - I need to examine what professionals and researchers are currently doing in the relevant field. This will help in identifying gaps, opportunities, and ensuring that my research is aligned with contemporary practices.

3. **Strategy for Moving Forward:**
   - I outlined a rough plan for proceeding with the research. This includes gathering more information on how to summarize user feedback effectively and verifying the quality of resources I use, such as through Scopus, SciVal, and the ACL Anthology for linguistics.

4. **Report Writing and Resource Verification:**
   - I emphasized the importance of selecting high-quality sources. Examples discussed include the Science Citation Index, Scopus, and others. The aim is to avoid reinventing the wheel by thoroughly reviewing relevant literature and identifying key research and ongoing work in the same area.
   - Key sections of the report include listing relevant papers, defining research questions, reviewing relevant work, and referencing researchers working in the same area.

## Work Completed

1. **Excel Sheet for Extensive Evaluation Criteria:**
   - In response to the assessment rubric shared in Week 4, I created an Excel sheet outlining the extensive evaluation criteria. This document reflects a thorough understanding of the assessment requirements and will be attached for review during the Week 5 meeting.

2. **Reflection Document:**
   - I compiled a document summarizing what has been understood so far in the project. This reflection has been attached and included in the resources to be reviewed before the Week 6 meeting.

## Work Being Completed

1. **Resource Collection and Initial Review:**
   - I am collecting and reviewing key papers using Google scholar, Scopus and SciVal, focusing on research relevant to my thesis topic.
   - I have identified a preliminary list of research questions based on the trends observed in the literature.

## Plan for Week 6

1. **Finalize Research Questions:**
   - Based on the discussions in Week 5, I will refine and finalize the research questions that my thesis will address.

2. **Literature Review:**
   - I will continue identifying and reviewing relevant papers, focusing on both the quality of sources and relevance to the research questions.
   - I will continue drafting the literature review section by summarizing key works and identifying where my research fits within the current landscape.

3. **Resource Verification:**
   - I will ensure all resources are verified for quality using indices such as Scopus, SciVal, and the ACL Anthology, focusing on user feedback summarising, linguistic side of this thesis as well as what's available.

4. **Summarizing User Feedback:**
   - I will continue exploring methods and tools for effectively summarizing user feedback, ensuring that this process is well-documented and can be easily integrated into the final thesis.

## Queries for Clarification

1. **Research Scope:**
   - Should I narrow down the research questions to focus on a specific sub-area within the field, or should the scope remain broad?

2. **Resource Quality:**
   - Are there any specific criteria or additional resources beyond Scopus, SciVal, and the ACL Anthology that I should consider for ensuring the quality of my sources if i run dry?

3. **User Feedback Summarization:**
   - Do you have any recommendations for tools or methods that would best suit the summarization of user feedback in the context of my research?
