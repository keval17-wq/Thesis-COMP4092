# Week 10 Logbook Entry

### Discussion Points
1. **Clustering Implementation**: Begin testing clustering on selected datasets.
2. **Iterative Evaluation**: Establish the criteria for iterative refinement of the summarization methodology.
3. **Preliminary Results**: Aim for initial clustering results to gauge effectiveness.

### Work Completed
1. Initial setup for clustering pipeline and data preprocessing.
2. Integrated ROUGE evaluation as a baseline.

### Work Being Completed
1. Testing clustering on small datasets for preliminary insights.
2. Refining project proposal with ongoing work.

### Plan for Week 11
1. Run clustering on larger datasets and analyze preliminary results.
2. Refine evaluation criteria based on preliminary findings.

### Queries for Clarification
1. Guidance on evaluating clustering quality for summarization?
2. Techniques to interpret clustering results effectively?
